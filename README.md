# Credit-Score-Prediction
This Python code performs several tasks related to credit score prediction. It also uses data visualization to display data in an easy-to-understand format. 

- Imports necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning. 
- Dataset is loaded from a CSV file and preprocessed to separate features and the target variable. 
- Gradient Boosting Regressor model is trained using grid search cross-validation to find the best hyperparameters. 
The user is prompted to input personal information such as income, credit limit, and education level, based on which their credit score is predicted using the trained model. 
- The program displays histograms comparing the distribution of the predicted credit score with other features in the dataset.

*Instead of credit score, the program can be trained on almost anything, given the data in a csv format. You can use this to predict products customers are likely to like, trends of a certain demographic, and how someone compares to others.This Python code performs several tasks related to credit score prediction.
